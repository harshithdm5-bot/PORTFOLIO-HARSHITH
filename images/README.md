## Required Images

To complete your portfolio website, you'll need to add the following images to this directory:

### Profile/Hero Images
- `hero-placeholder.jpg` (400x400px recommended) - Your professional profile photo

### Project Images
- `project1-placeholder.jpg` (600x300px recommended) - Smart Home Controller project image

- `book2-placeholder.jpg` (300x400px recommended) - "Advanced PCB Design" book cover

## Image Guidelines

- Use high-quality images (at least 300 DPI for print-ready books)
- Optimize images for web (compress to reasonable file sizes)
- Use consistent aspect ratios within each category
- Consider using WebP format for better compression
- Add alt text descriptions for accessibility

## Adding Your Images

1. Replace the placeholder file names with your actual images
2. Update the image references in `index.html` and `js/script.js` if you change the filenames
3. Ensure all images are optimized for web usage

## Fallback

If images are not available, the website will display gray placeholder rectangles with the specified background color (#f0f0f0) defined in the CSS.
